    `Each successful organization considers its achievements as a result conducting coherent and prepared steps. It recognizes a developed and appropriate plan as a foundation of all business affairs. Planning might be defined as an assessment of an organization's goals in terms of what resources are required and whether they will be available when they are needed. The solution to all issues is impossible without the development of plans for achieving goals. In enterprises, planning is inextricably linked to financial resources. A budget is a document containing the planned indicators of the organization for the near future. Then, this brings all factors to a common denominator, which fosters the implementation of the qualified plan. The planning process is constant and present at all levels and branches of a company. However, when it comes to the creation of the annual financial plan based on in-depth analysis and reasonable propositions, the budgeting process takes place. In this regard, I consider it as an extension of the planning process. I would define the Budget Committee as a permanent working group created to manage the budget process at the enterprise. It is formed from the heads of financial centers, functional directors, specialists of financial services, and other specialists of the company to organize and manage the budgeting process Kenton, 2019. Individuals that are to be invited by the Chief Financial Officer at the annual Budget Committee meeting are Marketing and Sales Director, COO, Director for Production, HR director, and Director for Logistics. Each of the mentioned persons is responsible for the reporting and functioning of the vital branches of the company. Based on their reports and propositions, the budget of the firm is to be formed as they have an opportunity to supervise and assess the performance of a branch directly. In my opinion, the main person of the Budget Committee is its supervisor usually, a CFO or CEO. Therefore, the successful implementation of the functions assigned to the Committee largely depends on how the company determines the duties, powers, and responsibilities of the supervisor. The example of a task performed by this individual that pertains to the managerial function of controlling might be as follows. By his or her decision to control the credibility of reports and proposals, an invitation to a meeting of the committee and specific materials for familiarization can be sent to the general director and experts.`,
  
    "The great advantage of early rising is the good start it gives us in our day's work. The early riser has done a large amount of hard work before other men have got out of bed. In the early morning the mind is fresh, and there are few sounds or other distractions, so that work done at that time is generally well done. In many cases the early riser also finds time to take some exercise in the fresh morning air, and this exercise supplies him a fund of energy that will last until the evening. By beginning so early, he knows that he has plenty of time to do thoroughly all the work he can be expected to do, and is not tempted to hurry over any part of it. All his work being finished in good time, he has a long interval of rest in the evening before the timely hour when he goes to bed. He gets to sleep several hours before midnight, at the time when sleep is most refreshing and after a sound night's rest, rises early next morning in good health and spirits for the labors of a new day. It is very plain that such a life as this is far more conducive to health than that of the man who shortens his waking hours by rising late, and so can afford in the course of the day little leisure for necessary rest. Anyone who lies in bed late, must, if he wishes to do a full day's work, go on working to a correspondingly late hour, and deny himself the hour or two of evening exercise that he ought to take for the benefit of his health. But in spite of all his efforts, he will probably produce as good results as the early riser, because he misses the best working hours of the day. It may be objected to this that some find the perfect quiet of midnight by far the best time for working. This is no doubt true in certain cases. Several great thinkers have found by experience that their intellect is clearest, and they can write best, when they burn the midnight oil. But even in such cases the practice of working late at night cannot be commended. Few men, if any, can exert the full power of their intellect at the time when nature prescribes sleep, without ruining their health thereby.",

    "Every class has a clown. Our class has Aman, otherwise known a Aman The Clown. He is always up to some prank or other, putting tails on the boy's pants, frogs in the girl's desks and powdered chalk on the teacher's chair. However, we all enjoy each other's company a lot, but sometimes we also end up having little fights. These fights are then resolved either with the help of the teachers or by classmates themselves. It is good that in the lunch time, we all sit together forming a big circle and eat our food together. We also share it with each other. The other classmates too have their own unique personalities. Each contributes his or her part to our class. In all, we are a group of young children who perhaps are a bit noisy at times, but overall are well- behaved and pleasant to be with. In case of need, I am sure that all my class mates would be standing together with each other. I am proud to be one of them. So, I like my class and classmates very much. When faced with a loss, crisis or life - changing event, we may be suddenly thrust into an unfamiliar world, one that is frightening and challenging. The first step towards coping with a loss is to accept the circumstances we are in. Non-acceptance or denial destroys peace of mind and gives rise to anger, anxiety and frustration. It may also lead to a feeling of self pity. In such a case, a person resigns himself to his fate and loses his self confidence. He is not able to cope with the reality. But a person who accepts the ups and downs of life and prepares himself to take life as a challenge gets a new strength from within to fight and succeed. The thought that there is nothing permanent in life, that highs must follow lows and lows have inevitably to be succeeded by highs can also prove to be encouraging. It can give us strength to face unfavorable circumstances with perseverance and fortitude. A business organization cannot function without Capital. A joint stock company which is modern form of business organization, cannot start, carry on and expand its activities unless it can raise capital. A company needs capital to purchase land, construct building, buy plant and machinery, raw materials, employ people, market its products, pay transport and warehousing charges etc.",

    "Dussehra is one of the main festivals of India which is celebrated on a very large scale. It is mainly celebrated by the Hindus. The celebration of Dussehra continues for almost ten days in some parts of India. This is celebrated almost twenty days before Diwali. This festival is celebrated around September or October. It reminds us of the victory of Lord Ram over the evil King Ravana. Lord Ram killed Ravana because he had kidnapped Sita. Hanuman helped Lord Ram to reach the kingdom of Ravana and save Sita from his captivity. Hanuman set Ravana's kingdom of fire with his tail. Lord Ram had a fierce battle with Ravana and finally managed to kill him. Therefore, this day is celebrated as Dussehra. Dussehra is celebrated differently in different parts of India. In West Bengal, people worship goddess Durga. The goddess had defeated Mahishasura, an evil demon, after a battle that lasted for nine days. The demon was finally defeated and killed on the tenth day. The crown and glory of life in character. It is neither power nor pelf nor even physical prowess but character alone that can bring glory to a man. Power corrupts and breeds bitterness and resentment; wealth is merely a passing shadow, endowing upon men but shadowy glamour, mere physical prowess is the attribute of a beast or a giant, it is only one's character - invincible moral courage, unimpeachable integrity, that can bring one personal satisfaction and high esteem among others. Character constitutes one's essence, what on really is. Want of character implies meaningless existence. If Gandhiji could transform the hearts of millions of people all over the world and shake the foundations of mighty British Empire, it was by virtue of his character, his unflinching faith in the earnestness of his cause and his unconquerable will power. He has immortalized himself because he was man of character. Character cannot be developed in a day. It takes years of self-exploration. India is a predominantly agrarian country. In India a variety of agricultural products is available. Different type of agro-based industries have come up. In addition to these industries processing agricultural products have also developed.

There has also been development of heavy industries like textiles and sugar. The establishment of industries and industrial development have an important role in the economic development of a country.",

    "Animals contribute greatly to the food chain Few species of animals are extinguishing because of destruction of forests, rivers, deserts, etc. It has been seen that we are polluting our environment largely. Air pollution is done by the vehicles and industries. Water pollution is done by humans and the factories they setup. Noise pollution also disturbs the surroundings. In some or the other way, we are taking too much from our environment but giving back very less to it. We are taking our environment for granted. Man has now begun to realize the importance of preserving our nature and protect our environment. Measures are being taken by the government and many NGOs. Killing of the wildlife and cutting down to trees are prohibited. Slowly, man is making effort to protect the environment, we live in. We live on earth and it is full of natural resources. Humans are we exploiting these resources. Every day many people need to buy, and others wish to sell their goods. Whenever and whenever these people meet there is a market, but it is not a market place in the usual sense. It may be round a stall, in a shop or in a ware house or factory. There are large and famous market under one roof, such as the stock exchange, and the various commodity markets, such as the cotton, wool and tea exchange. But markets need not be under one roof. A number of men connected by telephone, or even walking in and out of banks and offices to deal with each other can be a market. One example of this is the money market which does not exist in any one place but is simply a market arising from the demand for money. The markets that are familiar to most people, however, are the retail markets, and they are made up of stalls either in a street market, or in a market place. These stalls are very much sought after, and some retailers wait many years to get the stall they want, perhaps in a favorable place.

Though there has been significant achievement in Energy conservation in organized sectors like us, no improvements have come from unorganized sector viz., single operator. In the national perspective, transport planning process, in which transport is linked with other sector economy, and the choice and capacities of each mode of transport should be decided after giving due consideration to requirements of various sectors, costs, energy efficiency and other factors. Government of India has clearly emphasized energy conservation as the most important objective in National Transport Policy. Road Transport is a vital sector of Nation economy, and it claims a good share of the energy consumed. Out of villages are yet to be provided with all weather motorized routes. There will be minimum 10 per cent growth in energy consumption in the road transport conservation in Road Transport Section. Crores of rupees were spent in building roads to maintain them in good conditions. Generally, we keep talking about the weather conditions. We can identify the weather conditions through the conversations above. We experience the dampness or dryness in the air throughout the year.

    "India is not just the land, mountains and rivers. India is you and me, all the millions of young and old who are her citizens. The thoughts and actions of the people who have inhabited India for thousands of years have molded our society. Out of the past grows the present, and what we do today will shape our future. When we build a road or plant a tree or inoculate good habits, it is not for ourselves alone but also for those who will be born in the years to come. The work or building is not easy. We must give it all we have and strain every nerve and muscle. It is only by trying that we learn and by doing that we gather strength. All the world over, progress has been possible because of the hard work and sacrifice of pioneers. The children of today must continue this work and make our country united and strong. Anything which is easy soon becomes dull. The very hardships we face provide challenge and excitement. The future is calling you forever. Hobbies are good for everybody, but they are a mist for intellectuals and those who use their mental energies to earn their livelihood.

    "There is a sense of awe in the atmosphere as the nipping winds of winter pierce through one's body sending a chill down one's spine. The cold grows stifling and an overpowering numbness seizes one's entire existence. Trees shed their leaves and put on a bleak look. Fields look desolate. The sky wears mournful grey. But the Laws of Nature decree that winder cannot rule eternally. It is soon followed by spring and refreshing spring winds begin to blow. Their caressing touch rejuvenates life and there are sudden thrilling pulsations in the air. Streams gently roll, soft showering in one's ears. Flowers bloom and the air gets laden with soothing fragrance. The cyclic pattern of Nature is reflected in life as well. Suffering and misfortune may assail one for a while and envelop one's entire existence with drooping despair. But they must inevitably disappear and give way to hope and happiness as the fog disappears before the sun. Can you save one's vision from winter ? None but a fool is always right. We must be knowing people who always claim to be right. Howsoever fanciful, irrelevant or absurd their views on a subject may be, they assert they are right and are not prepared to brook any contradiction or challenge. Their cocksureness makes them presumptuous and this nature destroys all possibilities of acquiring knowledge. The first step towards knowledge is the realization of one's ignorance. How can a person who does not realize his ignorance ever be curious to acquire knowledge ? He contemptuously looks upon all opinions that differ from what he says and denies himself all possibilities of learning anything new. He is convinced that others are wrong while he is right. Then he fails to learn what is actually right. Darkness cannot be light, but unless a person realizes that he is wallowing in darkness, he can have no desire of going into light. Wisdom keeps away from such a person. He is doomed to unrelieved folly. And he never gets success. Information Technology is an important engineering branch in today 's world. In this branch, work is carried out by computers. In this industry, India has made rapid progress. The availability of skilled manpower is the most important reason for this.

    "I play many outdoor games such as tennis, football, hockey and badminton but the one I like most is cricket. I am a member of the college eleven. My highest individual score has been one hundred and seven not out and so far I have three hattricks to my credit. The eminent essayist Gardiner has rightly described cricket as a great game. A great game certainly is favorite to me. It is the king of Games, for so many reasons. Being essentially an outdoor game, it provides tough but healthy exercise and hardens the players. It makes them keen eyed, watchful, alert, precise, sure handed and quick footed. Cricket is a democratic game. It brings together on an equal footing the rich and the common people. Since it depends on teamwork, it promotes the healthy spirit of brotherhood and fine sense of sportsmanship. It has universal appeal. It is also tremendously exciting. I know how my heart leaps up when I hit a sixer or how it sinks when my middle stump is off. Tea is my favorite drink and I can drink tea whether it is strong or weak or if it is only brown in colour. As long as the liquid is very hot, I can drink tea at any time of the day, or night. If you like tea, then no doubt you have sampled this particular kind of refreshment when visiting your friends or relatives, but have you ever noticed how these different people seem to make tea in varying strength according to their characters. To illustrate this point, I would like to give you one or two examples. One of may friends is a teacher and the tea made in his household is medium brown in colour. The tea is never too strong nor too weak, it is exactly right and no matter how many times one may visit my friend, the colour of the tea he serves never changes. Another friend of mine is a minor and at his house one can be sure of drinking a liquid that is so deep and brown that looks like a cup of dark chocolate. The tea served by him is very strong. I can drink tea at any time of the day or night. One of may friends is a teacher and the tea made in his household is brown in colour.

    "The family is a basic unit of the society. Family consists of two or more persons staying together in the same household who are related to each other by blood, marriage or adoption. As soon as family is established and people begin to work for common purpose, need for formulating a plan of action arises. It also becomes necessary to delegate responsibilities, to organize and control the use of available human and nonhuman resources. Management is the natural outgrowth of human association in the home environment. It is a basic expectation of everyone that a sound environment is created in the house, where the members come together with love and affection for each other. Efficient and effective management plays a very crucial role here. It is a means of using available resources for the achievement of family goals, loading to satisfaction and happiness.

    "Today, in the bus, on my way back to home from school, I was thinking about my class. I have many good friends in my class. Ours is class of thirty people. I know everyone of them. I feel lucky to have these boys and girls as my classmates. All the children come from different family backgrounds, but when they are in one class, they are addressed together. It feels great to be part of them all. My all classmates are very helpful. Each student is of different nature. Few of them are very naughty, few are studious. Everybody is good in some or the other activity. Teachers are fond of our class as we have talents in our class in every field. Even of somebody is weak, other classmates help him or her to cope up. Teachers also say that we are a noisy lot. This is largely due to Rahul. He is the noisiest of us all. In this noisy bunch lives a boy, Akshat, who hardly ever opens his mouth, the boy who sits next to me. He is a gentle and soft creature always with smile. John Keats, one of the celebrated romantic poets, Not only physical beauty but moral purity and mental excellence is also important. A thing of beauty is a joy for ever. And he goes on to assert that its loveliness keeps increasing with the passage of time and it never passes into nothingness. Keats's concept of beauty is quite comprehensive. It includes, besides physical beauty, mental excellence and moral purity. If an object is to be a source of permanent joy, it must be beautiful in its entirety and not just physically attractive. Skin deep beauty decays fast. But beauty ingrained in the tissues of an object is a permanent quality. The very touch of this kind of beauty comforts one's heart and elevates one mentally and morally. If we are surrounded by real beauty of the kind conceived of by Keats, it moves away the pal of darkness from our spirits and enables us to shed our despondency and regain our happiness. India is a land of villages. A major portion of our population lives in villages. Cities are few. Obviously, the prosperity of our nation depends upon the prosperity of our villages.

We also use sometimes small pieces of rubber to erase mistakes in writing. Rubber is a interesting substance. It change its shape when we press it. As soon as we stop pressing it, it springs back to its first shape. We, therefore, say that rubbers elastic. It bounces too. When we throw a rubber ball on the ground, it bounces.

He was deeply and actively interested in the growth and development of science in India, for his long study of history and social development and convinced him that the progress, prosperity and independence of a country was indissolubly linked with its advancement in the field of science and technology. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, with its national laboratories and other scientific organisation, represents a considerable segment of our national effort. Although this scientific effort is still small in relation to our needs and aspirations, it represents a substantial quantum of human and financial resources.

I was the last child of a small-town government servant, in a family of five brothers. My earliest memory of my father is as that of a district employment officer in Koraput, Orissa.

    "The environment is the natural surroundings that we live in. Natural surroundings include plants, trees, deserts, forests, animals, lakes, rivers, mountains, and so on. We are also a part of it. The survival of humans is based on nature. In fact, we are completely dependent on environment and its natural resources. We live on earth and it is full of natural resources. Humans are using and exploiting, the environment for its own use. We don't realize that if we keep exploiting it, we will have to pay a very high price. Many living beings are dependent of forests. These forests are being destroyed by cutting down of the trees. This is affecting the animals, which depend on them for food and shelter. This further disturbs the food chain. In addition, soil is loosening and erosion has become a great problem. Lakes and river is another natural resource on which many lives are dependent. Adversity can prove highly beneficial to mankind. It can bring one courage, maturity and understanding. Having once been through adverse circumstances, one is certain to face the rest of one's life with greater courage and confidence. Adversity also develops a man's capacity to sympathies with the suffering humanity. He who has never suffered can never understand what suffering is. The value of tears can be appreciated only by a man who has shed them himself. Adversity purifies a man. Gold, when it is melted in fire, gets purified. It is a proverbial saying that God sends us into deep water not to drawn us but to wash us clean. Adversity also provides a man with an opportunity to test the sincerity of those who claim to be sincere to him. Prosperity gains friends, adversity tries them. Besides, adversity, by contrast, enhances the pleasure of prosperity. Adversity can be really useful to man provided he has a positive attitude towards life. Thus, sweet are the fruits of adversity. The pattern of energy consumption in rural areas is important in any understanding of rural energy developments. With this end in view, let us examine the type of energy usage that takes place in the rural areas. Human Society acts on nature to produce either food or goods which are then consumed. Unlike animals, human beings not only acquire but also transform natural produce. Any such trans- formation requires energy as a necessary input.",

    "Villages live in a poor and unhygienic condition. Mostly houses own some animals like cows, buffaloes, etc. for milk. They have to feed these animals too. These animals make the place dirty. In the villages, there are proper roads and lights are not there. Now, in most of the villages, electricity has reached which has made their life better largely. Villagers tolerate all the seasons, like summers, rains and winter with great difficulty. They don't have proper means to live their life conveniently. They are used to work hard and meat the ends.

    "General meaning of petrification is turning/converting into rock. However, in paleontology, it is defined as a process of removal and replacement of organic matter by inorganic minerals. It is believed that in the process of petrification, the replacement takes place molecule by molecule gradually. The Silicified wood or wood opal is the most common petrified fossil. Such fossils show many internal and external details and permit to study anatomical and morphological details. The replacement of organic matter is partial or total that has given rise to a matter of debate. There are about twenty mineral substances known to cause petrifaction. But the most common are silica, calcite, dolomite, pyrite, limonite etc. Accordingly, petrify action may be a result of silicification, calcification, pyritization. The process of formations of replica of the original form of organism, often results into a very interesting mode of preservation. Many times, it happens that the interior of a shell filled by mud. Honesty is the best policy, is a well-known saying. It means that honesty helps a person in being successful or achieving his aims. Instead of making honesty only a matter of policy, we should make it a matter of faith, the foundation of all our actions, whether it leads to our success or not. We should not be honest only when it suits us or for selfish reasons, but it should be a matter of principle with us. It is possible that a person who is honest in all his dealings may not grow rich as fast as a dishonest person, but the success achieved by as honest person will be of a pure kind, earned without cheating or injustice. One might as well ask what exactly is meant by honesty is meant by honesty. It is nothing but being honest to oneself and to the duty one performs. A man may be working in a bank or in a factory or on a farm, or he may be daily wage earner, he gets his happiness and satisfaction from the sense of honesty with which he does his work. Dishonesty does not mean cheating people. Dhira was a shoeshine boy. He lost his father when he was very young and now lived in a jhuggi with his mother and sister. Dhira was a hard working boy. After school, he would sit near a cinema hall and polish shoes for a living. One day it was very bot.",

    "My Lord Mayor, I think you for the great honour you have done me in presenting me with the freedom of the City of London. I am well aware that it is your most precious gift, and it makes me very proud to be invited to join the great company of past and present freemen. Since the last war you have taken the opportunity to honour those men principally responsible for the Allied victory. All of them were great leaders or men, whether in Parliament, in civil life, or in the field of battle, But, my Lord Mayor, in every kind of human activity there are those who lead and there are those who follow. You have honoured leaders, Now if you will allow me, I would like to accept the Freedom of this City, not only for myself, but for all those millions who followed during the Second World War. Our only distinction is that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it. Good leaders undoubtedly got the best out of us and without their leadership our efforts would fruitless. The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world. This proverbial statement emphasises the role of a mother in the building or a nation. This role is indisputable indeed. A mother is the best nurse, guide and guardian that a child can have. It is for her to make a saint of him of a dacoit. It is for her to cultivate in him undaunted courage of object cowardice. The formative years of a man's life are spent in the lap of his mother. Whatever stamp of mould his impressionable day gets from his mother becomes his permanent mark, Shivaji, the great Indian warrior, learnt the fundamental lessons of warfare from his mother, who also inspired him with the legends of the great heroes of the old. Almost all the great men of the world will graterfully acknowledge the influence of their mother in their early development, although, women having a self-effecting nature, this influence may not be recorded anywhere. Some one really said that Swami Tinhi Jagacha Aaivina Bhikari. The work which has been going on regarding the minds of men suggests that one fifth of a second is about a limit for most of us in the matter of the useful division of time in our minds. But one fifth of a second.",

    "The jute mill industry's plea for bank credit to maintain raw jute stocks equal to four month's production requirement and the Government of West Bengal's repeated urging to provide the Jute Corporation of India with the wherewithal to purchase a minimum of 2 million bales assume urgency as marketing of new season fibre will gain momentum in a few weeks. The uniform good monsoon in all jute producing States will make it possible to harvest a crop of over 80 lakh bales during the 1980-81 season. Since total supplies will be enlarged by brought forward stocks of approximately 3 million bales, the specter of a price crest in up country markets has been raised. Hopefully neither the industry nor the Government at the Centre and the States is oblivious of the prospect of large-scale distress sales by millions of growers. At the urging of the Government milks within and outside the Indian Jute Mills Association have agreed to complete purchases of 6 lakh bales of raw jute. Too many people seem to be content to spend their time in just carrying out the purposes of others. They work for nothing but the pay, they think more about the pay than the purpose. Give them the pay, and somebody else can have the purpose, for all they care. In this way millions of people live unhappy lives just I because they do not have a purpose you can and should have a purpose of your own. At the same time you can serve the purpose of another and serve it even better. You can still have the pay and yet be working out your own purpose. Remember that all good purposes tend in the same direction and go land in hand. Decide now that you will have a purpose, then your life will be the richer. Your eyes will soon, begin reading all the copy you are typing by phrases or world groups. The words combine into a short chain. Every time your eyes see that chain of words, you set up a chain of acts that enable you to reproduce the word group. So there should be a purpose in our life. After Independence the Government of India passed the Industrial Policy Resolution in 1948. It laid down the pattern of mixed economy specifying the industrial field of public sector and private sector to operate. This Resolution envisaged a mixed economy as suitable basis for the future economic development of the country.",

    "Everybody is born with a beautiful skin uniform is colour, firm and smooth to the touch. Over the years, improper care, a wrong diet and poor circulation damage the skin. To look after your skin intelligently, you must understand its structure, and what is needed to deep it healthy and glowing. Your skin is made up of an epidermis, where rows of living cells are topped by a thin film of deed cells. Below this lies the dermis, which contains the blood vessels, oil and sweat glands. The connective tissues are held together by collagen which gives the skin its firmness flexibility and strength. An important function of the skin, besides regulating body temperature, is to maintain an adequate supply of a fatty substance called sebum. These sebaceous glands are supposed to keep the skin well-oiled; but they do not always do this well enough. If they are over-active, acne is the result, if under-active, wrinkles appear. The function of the epidermis the outer layer is thus protective. It shield body bacteria. In a small business concern goods received may well be unpacked by the owner and invoice, or packing note, checked at the same time. He may also check the goods against the order to ensure that they are as ordered both as to type and quantity. If the business is large enough for this work to be entrusted to others, it is the responsibility of the owner to control it by making checks from time to time. No question of fraud is being considered here, control in this case being to ensure that goods received are those required. The system of checking will change with the number of staff available. The work to be done is to check goods against the order goods against invoice, pricing of Invoice and then checking them into store. Some method will have to be followed to ensure that these checks are carried out with all goods arriving. If it is possible to entrust the work, so that a different person is inchange of each section that will help the owner of the business but this is not always possible.

    "Travelling is an important part of human life. It gives you a break form your busy life and makes you feel renewed for a new start. It takes away all you stress and improves your health and mind. We can explore the serene nature around us and meet new people. This makes us feel livelier. For so long I wanted to take my parents out for a trip. Since last time I planned to visit Goa to take a break and refresh myself. It was such a thrilling trip. I enjoyed all three days spent in Goa. The overall trip was very good. I had so much fun with my family. The sun and the sky were clear. I expected rain but there was no sign of it. I prefer to travel in the summer season. Rains can drench area pretty quickly. It also ruins your plans and spoils the whole trip. I have seen many tourists in Goa. People come from so far to spend some good time here. It is nice to meet new people. I really like Goa for many reasons. I like beaches. It was my dream place as I have heard many things about this place. So, I fulfilled my dream and reached Goa to enjoy my life and get away from the daily hustles. It is no new news that travel is good for your body but there are many researchers which suggest that exploring a new place can do wonders for your mental and emotional health as well. A trip enhances your mood. It gives you a reason to smile. I believe that a person should go on a trip once a month. I am always busy when I travel it is taking photos or just exploring a place on foot. I know I am the calmest and most relaxed when I travel. Also, the lessons you learn along the way make you more aware and open to new things. I Love going to places with different cultures because it forces you to think about your own. When you explore new places, you give yourself a chance of fresh start. It makes you feel calm. When you are going through a tough time in your life it gives you more clarity. I think people in general are not meant to be tied down to just one place their entire lives.",

    "Welcome to a journey through the heart of our planet the environment. In this exploration, we uncover the intricate dance of Earth's essential components the air we breathe, the water that sustains life, the solid ground beneath our feet, and the vibrant tapestry of living ecosystems. But, our human footprint leaves traces of challenges like climate change, pollution, and habitat loss. Join us as we unravel the secrets of the environment, understand its delicate balance, and discover practical ways to preserve and protect it for a sustainable and healthier future. Let's embark on this eco-friendly adventure together. Our surroundings, like nature and all the things around us, are super important. They affect how we become as we grow up. Saving our environment is crucial for many good reasons. In recent decades, our environment has faced big dangers. The atmosphere is the blanket of gases that surrounds our planet, providing the air we breathe. Composing nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and trace gases, it plays a crucial role in regulating temperature and supporting life. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases, leading to global warming and climate change. The hydrosphere encompasses all the water on Earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and underground aquifers. Water is essential for all forms of life, but pollution, over-extraction, and climate change threaten the availability and quality of this precious resource. Understanding sustainable water management practices is crucial for preserving the hydrosphere. The lithosphere consists of the Earth's solid outer layer, including the continents and ocean floors. Human activities, such as deforestation, mining, and urbanization, impact the lithosphere, leading to soil erosion, habitat loss, and alterations in land use. Exploring sustainable land management practices is vital for maintaining the health of the lithosphere. The biosphere is the sum of all ecosystems on Earth, where living organisms interact with their environment. Biodiversity, the variety of life on Earth, is a key aspect of the biosphere. Human activities, including deforestation and pollution, threaten biodiversity, leading to the loss of species and ecosystem degradation. Conservation efforts and sustainable practices are essential for preserving the delicate balance of the biosphere. Climate change, driven by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, results in rising global temperatures and extreme weather events. Understanding the science behind climate change and adopting sustainable practices is crucial for mitigating its impact.",

    `Road safety is more than just a buzzword; it is an essential part of our daily lives that has a direct impact on our well-being and the prosperity of our communities. With millions of lives lost each year due to road accidents worldwide, the urgency of addressing road safety concerns has never been greater. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve into the complexities of road safety, investigating its significance, global statistics, and the factors that jeopardize road safety. Let's go on a journey to learn about the importance of road safety and how each of us can help to make our streets safer. At its core, "road safety" encompasses the measures and practices designed to ensure the safety of individuals while using the road. Governments worldwide have established rules and procedures to be followed by all road users, including pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists. Traffic signals, signboards, security cameras, dividers, and footpaths are some of the tools implemented to enforce road safety and regulate traffic. Understanding the global road safety landscape is critical for developing effective strategies. Because of extensive road networks and strict precautionary measures, developed countries frequently have better road safety records. On the other hand, developing and underdeveloped countries face a bleaker reality. According to shocking statistics, approximately 1.5 million lives are lost globally each year as a result of road accidents, with over 90 percent of these occurring in developing countries. More than half of these fatalities are caused by vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists. Children and youth are disproportionately affected, making road safety a pressing concern for communities all over the world. Road safety is more than just a personal concern; it has far-reaching consequences for communities and nations. The consequences of a fatal car accident affect more than just the victim's dependents and loved ones. Furthermore, road crashes cost countries a significant portion of their GDP, highlighting the economic impact of poor road safety. Survivors of car accidents frequently suffer from long-term disabilities, putting financial strain on both individuals and nations. As a result, prioritizing road safety is critical for achieving sustainable development goals and ensuring society's overall prosperity and growth. To address road safety effectively, it's essential to identify the factors that compromise it. Several elements contribute to road accidents, and understanding them is the first step toward implementing impactful countermeasures. Strict enforcement of traffic regulations, including substantial fines for violations, can contribute to reducing the number of accidents caused by unruly behavior.`,

    `Pollution today poses a major threat to the survival of the world we live in. Smoke or dust released in the air is the major type of pollution as it is extremely bad for the humans as it directly affects the lungs. Sewage, harmful content in drinking water is another major type of pollution that makes people unhealthy and ill because it contains disease-causing germs and viruses. The environmental consequences of sudden rapid industrialization have resulted in various incidents of land, air and water resources sites being contaminated with toxic materials and other pollutants, threatening humans and ecosystems with serious health risks. During manufacturing and construction activities every bit of natural resources is exploited to covert these into goods that fulfil the needs of the countries. A major cause for all the causes listed above is the manufacturing that leads to major types of pollution. People living next to a building site where there is too much noise and construction activities rigorously going on tend to fall sick. Pollution can be considered as direct or indirect change in any component of the biosphere that is harmful to the living components and in particular undesirable for humans, affecting adversely the industrial progress, cultural and natural assets or general environment of living society. The biggest irony of all this is that even if we know that the earth is getting polluted, ultimately it is the human beings themselves who dig their own grave by doing deliberate activities because of which pollution is caused. It does not only spoil human beings' health but also worsen their quality of life. The Government has launched various pollution prevention policies and Acts that focus on preventing and controlling pollution by random means such as the following: Adoption of clean and low waste technology, reusing and recycling, environment audit and pollution monitoring activities, reducing hazardous materials at source wherever feasible, promoting recycling of waste, etc. There has also been a concept called "Pollution prevention approach" that seeks to increase the efficiency of a process reducing the amount of pollution generated at its source. To give effect to the government policies, various steps have been initiated which include statutory stringent regulations, development of environmental standards, control of pollution generated through vehicles, spatial environmental planning including industrial estates and preparation of zoning atlas. The policy statement for reduction of pollution lays emphasis on preventive aspects of pollution decline and promotion of technologies that help to reduce pollution.`,

    "Farmers' suicide has become a national problem in our country. Every other day we come across news about the farmers committing suicide in different parts of the country. Undoubtedly the farmers play an important role in the progress and development of the country, but still if they get prompted to end their lives due to any reason so far, it is a matter of grave concern. A major reason why the farmers commit suicide is that they borrow huge amount of money from moneylenders or from their landlords for their harvest, but many times they fail to repay the huge debt. Such situation becomes more difficult for those farmers who don't have their own land to cultivate their crops. For the purpose of farming, they take land from the landlords under the agreement of Batai which means the harvest shall be divided equally between the farmers and their landlords. Due to this system many times nothing comes into the hands of the farmers because they give half of the crop to their landlords and the other half of the crop is used in the part-payment of the loan taken from the landlords or the money lenders. On the other hand, landlords bear no responsibility other than suddenly entering into the scene when the harvest is ready, just to collect their share. We are already aware that in our country, every year the farmers have to suffer huge losses either due to floods, or draughts. Whatever may be the reason so far for the loss of their crops, they end-up empty handed and fail to repay their debt. In such a scenario, they suffer from humiliation and in such a situation their persisting mental agony compels them to commit suicide. We all know that our lives depend on the crops harvested by these farmers and so, the Government should immediately find out some ways to help these farmers. The Government should carefully consider all those issues which compel the farmers to commit suicide and moreover, it should also fix all those issues immediately. In almost every village of the country, the condition of the farmers is more or less same. When they fail to repay their loans, they find it more convenient to end their life then to face the social humiliation. The only solution to avoid this problem lies with the Government which is required to run crop guarantee scheme, besides it may also arrange for providing loans to the farmers on negligible interest rate.",

    "Natural calamities are occurrences that take place as natural disturbances, resulting in widespread destruction of lives and properties. Thousands of people in India are killed every year due to natural calamities such as floods, earthquakes, heavy rains, cloud bursts, lightning, landslides, and other natural disasters. Later, thousands of people die from diseases caused by natural disasters. Despite widespread destruction caused by these occurrences, the country does not have an effective disaster management system in place. Earthquakes, landslides, droughts, floods, tsunamis and cyclones are major examples of natural calamities. In terms of earthquakes, Himalayan, sub-Himalayan regions, Kutch and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are the seismically vulnerable regions in India. Earthquake is caused by the increase in internal pressure between the tectonic plates – huge rock pieces within the earth's crust – which causes them to break apart. The earth starts shaking and if earthquake's seismic intensity is high it leads to collapse of buildings, houses, bridges etc., leading to loss of lives and properties. In addition to simple and mild earthquakes, severe earthquakes have occurred in different parts of the country such as Uttarkashi 1991, Latur 1993 and Jabalpur 1997. Landslide occurs due to sliding of rocks caused by gravity, friction, earthquakes, rains and man-made acts. Draught is caused by the fall of lower volumes of rain. It is mainly of three types – of meteorology, hydrology and agriculture-related. The 16 percent area in the country is drought prone. Severe drought occurred in the country in 1941, 1951, 1979, 1982 and 1987. North-western part of the country is highly drought-prone region. Floods come due to more rain in a short time, low pressure areas and low exit-flow. India is the second highly affected country where floods are common in the rainy season. Nearly every year, terrible floods occur leading to occurrences such as loss of life, damage to property, and human health problems. National Flood Commission has determined 40 million hectares of land as the flood-prone area in the country. Ganga, Brahmaputra, Narmada, Tapi, Godavari, Krishna and Cauvery river valleys comprise most flood prone areas. Typhoons occur due to earthquake tsunami in the oceans. Cyclones come due to temperature and pressure variations in the ocean. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, 5 to 6 tropical cyclones take place every year. West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu parallel to the east coast in the Bay of Bengal, and Gujarat and Maharashtra parallel to the west coast in the Arabian Sea states are the areas with high potential for cyclones and tsunamis.",

    "71 percent of the earth's surface is covered with water. It is vital to all forms of life found on the earth. It is found below the ground, in oceans, large water bodies, and small water reservoirs. Water is also available in many forms like vapor, clouds, precipitation, surface water, glaciers, polar ice caps, etc. The life cycle of water runs all around the earth continuously through evaporation, precipitation, runoff, rain, etc. We also lack clean drinking water in many areas of the country. Water scarcity is the lack of access to safe water. Slowly, it is hard to manage the quality of water for the people who lack it. In some areas, lack of water is a daily problem. People have to suffer a lot from the scarcity of water. It takes a lot of effort, cost, and time to manage water access, especially in water scarcity. It is a big issue in many countries worldwide. People having sufficient water do not understand the importance of water, and they waste a lot of water daily on many unnecessary activities. We all know that around 2 or less percent of water is fresh water on the earth and fit for human consumption. Most of the water is locked up in glaciers, snow, ice, and other forms of open source. The main source of freshwater is groundwater because of the natural filtering system. The matter of freshwater availability raises the question of water security and people's access to it at an affordable price. The groundwater depth is increasing with the huge climatic changes in the environment. Clean water insecurity in many places has increased due to the drought and natural disasters without season. In the coming decades, the demand for clean water will increase because of population growth, the need for agriculture and industry will expand, negative climatic changes, etc. It's time to join our hands and take effective actions regarding saving water as much as possible. There are different ways we can save huge amounts of water daily. Water saving can be done through water conservation methods. Saving water and protecting it from being dirty has been necessary to meet current and future demands. Climate change is another factor in water scarcity. Water demands will increase in the future, so it should be saved to ensure its availability for future generations. If we do not take positive action, the condition will be more embarrassing when the rate of lack of fresh water from an ecosystem exceeds its natural replacement rate.",

    "Female foeticide is a crime against women as it debars them to take birth. Of late, sex-selective abortions to get only male kids born in the family have gained momentum. Though the medical techniques used to determine sex of the child been helpful in various surgeries or treatments required to avoid complications during the birth and to know more about the health of the unborn baby, however, this technique is being used quite often for sex-selective abortions. Eliminating female foetus in the womb of a woman is possible with the help of simple techniques starting from ultrasound and then some medicines which forces the foetus to die. To stop the evil practice of female foeticide, strict punishment in the form of fine or jail to the person requesting abortion of the unborn girl child is prescribed under Pre Natal-Diagnostics Techniques PNDT Act. Simultaneously the practitioner who helps in sex determination for this purpose is also required to be punished equally. But the PNDT has failed to check female infanticide as the sex determination and services needed for the same have mushroomed accordingly. Law has been unable to curb the misuse of ultrasound machines by unscrupulous operators. After the determination of female foetus, many women go for abortion of their own accord. Sometimes they forced by their family members who find some medical practitioners willing to carry the surgical procedure against the enforced law. Though there is little justification for the unscrupulous murder of female foetus, three is an increasing trend of families in urban as well as rural regions across the country going for the illegal practice of sex-determination test. On its part, the government has attempted to regulate the use of pre-natal diagnostic techniques for legal or medical purposes through the PNDT Act 1994 and has also set up a central body to check killing of female foetus through abortion. Also, we cannot blame the entire doctor community for carrying out sex-selective tests. It's only an unscrupulous bunch of doctors who become willing partners of parents in not allowing many girls to come into this world. The winds of change have now started blowing in the society with girls doing well in diverse professions, which were considered male-bastions up until now, such as boxing, wrestling, martial arts, armed forces, etc. Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao Save and educate the girl child has become a countrywide movement.",

    "Women empowerment has become the buzzword today with women working alongside men in all spheres. They profess an independent outlook, whether they are living inside their home or working outside. They are increasingly gaining control over their lives and taking their own decisions with regard to their education, career, profession and lifestyle. With steady increase in the number of working women, they have gained financial independence, which has given them confidence to lead their own lives and build their own identity. They are successfully taking up diverse professions to prove that they are second to none in any respect. But while doing so, women also take care to strike a balance between their commitment to their profession as well as their home and family. They are playing multiple roles of a mother, daughter, sister, wife and a working professional with remarkable harmony and ease. With equal opportunities to work, they are functioning with a spirit of team work to render all possible co-operation to their male counterparts in meeting the deadlines and targets set in their respective professions. Women empowerment is not limited to urban, working women but women in even remote towns and villages are now increasingly making their voices heard loud and clear in society. They are no longer willing to play a second fiddle to their male counterparts. Educated or not, they are asserting their social and political rights and making their presence felt, regardless of their socio-economic backgrounds. While it is true that women, by and large, do not face discrimination in society today, unfortunately, many of them face exploitation and harassment which can be of diverse types: emotional, physical, mental and sexual. They are often subjected to rape, abuse and other forms of physical and intellectual violence. Women empowerment, in the truest sense, will be achieved only when there is attitudinal change in society with regard to womenfolk, treating them with proper respect, dignity, fairness and equality. The rural areas of the country are, by and large, steeped in a feudal and medieval outlook, refusing to grant women equal say in the matters of their education, marriage, dress-code, profession and social interactions. Let us hope, women empowerment spreads to progressive as well as backward areas of our vast country. We are living in an age of women empowerment. Women over the world are working shoulder to shoulder with men. By and large, they are now empowered to make decision about different aspects of their life and profession.",

    "Terrorism is an act of repeated violence committed by semi-clandestine individual, group or state actors, for peculiar, criminal or political reasons. The immediate human victims of terrorism are generally chosen randomly or selectively representative or symbolic targets from a target population, and serve as message generators. India has long been a victim of terrorism. Terrorism in India is said to be largely sponsored by Pakistan, through its secret service and intelligence agency, Inter-Services Intelligence ISI. Pakistan has consistently denied its involvement, but in July 2016, the Indian Government released the data on a series of terror strikes in India since 2005 that claimed 707 lives and left over 3,200 injured, all pointing at Pakistan's involvement. Kidnapping has been a favorite tactic employed by terrorist groups whether they are religious or non-religious for ransom. They have sought to make others agree to their demands through kidnapping. For instance, a Romanian diplomat was kidnapped by the Khalistan Commando Force, a Sikh terrorist group, in New Delhi in 1991. Similarly, the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front kidnapped some Israeli tourists in J&K in 1992. Terrorist groups have affinity with terrorist groups of their ilk in other countries. For instance, the Marxist groups of India are aligned with Maoist groups of Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The separatist, terrorist Kashmiri outfits are connected with the religious, fundamentalist and jihadi organizations of Pakistan. Similar is the link between the Students Islamic Movement of India SIMI with jihadi elements in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The overseas diaspora too funds and supports home-grown terrorist groups both in moral and material terms. In its heydays, the Khalistan movement in Punjab found a resonance with the overseas Sikh community in the UK and Canada and flourished rapidly. The Mirpuris, migrants from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, who have settled in Western countries, are said to help Kashmiri organizations in all sorts of ways. Similarly, the Marxist groups within India find encouragement and support from the people of Marxist leanings within the overseas Indian community. There are several causes of terrorism in India: political, economic, and religious. The political cause of terrorism is primarily seen in Tripura and Assam where the political factors resulted in terrorism after the respective state governments failed to control and manage the large-scale illegal Muslim immigration from Bangladesh. The terrorist outfits capitalized upon the alienation of the daughters and sons of the soil who did not wish to share the opportunities of employment with the refugees.",

    "Society is defined as a collection of people living together in an ordered community. A well-ordered community share common infrastructure and economy and live in unison displaying unity and integrity, without hatred or remorse. What brings order to a society? Ever wondered that, why do some societies keep a constructive approach towards life and development while some fight among themselves for money, drugs and other trivial issues. As we dwell deep into the behavior of societies, we realize that, it is the state of literacy and the prevailing educational psychology in a society, those are primarily responsible for its development and success. A society behaves depending on the status of education and literacy of its individuals. A society which realizes the importance of schools for its children and has good schools and educational institutions backed by dedicated faculty; is on the right path towards development. An educated society can look after the needs of its children, students, youth as well as and elders and strive for development; taking everybody in account. A society which is educated nurtures the younger generation in a much better way than the uneducated society, so that they grow up to become content and happy individuals; contributing to the nation's growth. An uneducated society, on the other hand has many odds on its side than the evens. A society that constitutes of uneducated and illiterate people cannot provide basic amenities for itself; neither it has the vision to do so. The individuals in such societies don't have the perception of development, nor do they strive for it; living a deprived and rather depressed life. These societies have poor state of health, hygiene, economy and not to mention poor education; latter being the root cause behind all their issues. Such societies are unable to provide necessary education to the individuals and youths, pushing them towards criminal activities to fend for the needs of themselves and their families. The young are malnourished, deprived and forced into labor; sealing their own fate as well as the fate of the society. An educated society makes sure that its younger generation is also educated while an illiterate society breeds illiterate generations, who struggle in life even to meet their basic needs of food and health. Illiterate parents are least likely to promote education to their wards, so pushing them towards deprivation and labor. A literate society on the other hand, makes sure that its children too are educated and provides necessary infrastructure and logistics for it.",

    "As per estimates, poor hygiene and sanitation facilities cost India 600,000 lives annually due to diarrhea and other such diseases. As per government data of 2011, India is home to 450 million people who do not have access to toilets and they defecate in the open. Not only this, lack of toilets also exposes one third of country's women to the risk of sexual assault. Swachh Bharat Mission SBM or Clean India Mission was launched by Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi on the 145th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on October 2, 2014, at Rajghat in New Delhi. This national campaign, initiated by the Government of India, covers 4041 statutory towns across the country and aims to make the streets, roads and infrastructure clean by October 2, 2019, i.e. Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary. This mission to clean India's cities and villages is estimated to cost around Rs. 62,000 crores. It's the most celebrated scheme of the recent time which aims to combat dirtiness and generate awareness among the citizens of India about the importance of sanitation and hygiene. Millions of people, celebrities, politicians, academic institutions, NGOs, and local community centers across the country joined this cleanliness initiative of the government by organizing cleanliness drives across the country. From Bollywood actors to the sportsperson, government officials to Army men, industrialists to spiritual leaders, all are willingly contributing towards making India clean. The Union Ministry of Urban Development is managing the urban component of the SBM, while the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation is handling the rural component of the mission. Students of schools are also organizing frequent cleanliness campaigns to spread awareness about hygiene through plays and other modes. The Government of India launched the Total Sanitation Campaign TSC with effect from April 1, 1999. To provide a major fillip to the TSC, the government launched an incentive scheme in June 2003 in the form of an award for comprehensive sanitation coverage, preservation and protection of environment and open defecation-free panchayat villages, blocks, and districts namely Nirmal Gram Puraskar. The TSC was further renamed as Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan NBA. On October 2, 2014, the campaign was renamed and launched as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan or Swachh Bharat Abhiyan Mission (SBM) to fulfill Mahatma Gandhi's vision of 'Clean India'. The mission aims to eradicate open defecation by 2019. Prime Minister while launching the SBM, called for making the goal of Swachh Bharat as a mass movement, with people taking a pledge to neither litter, nor let others litter.",

    `India's G20 presidency brings with it a meaningful logo that combines the Earth with the lotus, India's national flower, under the theme 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' or 'One Earth-One Family-One Future.' The G20 logo is a vibrant blend of India's national flag colours – saffron, white, green, and blue. The Earth in the logo reflects India's commitment to a pro-planet lifestyle, living in harmony with nature. Highlighting 'LIFE' Lifestyle for Environment, the theme motivates making eco-friendly choices both in personal lifestyles and national development. These choices are aimed at creating a cleaner, greener, and bluer future globally. For India, the G20 Presidency also marks the beginning of "Amrit Kaal," a 25-year period from the 75th anniversary of independence 15 August 2022 to the centenary of independence. This period envisions a futuristic, prosperous, inclusive, and developed society with a core focus on human-centric values. The G20, or Group of 20, is a unique gathering of 19 independent countries, the European Union EU, and the African Union AU. This intergovernmental forum was established in 1999 to tackle major global economic issues, ranging from financial stability to climate change and sustainable development. Comprising finance ministries from the world's largest economies, the G20 includes both industrialized and developing nations. Together, they make up a significant portion of the global economy, contributing to about 80 percent of the gross world product GWP, 75 percent of international trade, and representing two-thirds of the world's population and 60 percent of its land area. G20 was born in response to economic crises. the G20 has been meeting annually since 2008. These gatherings involve the heads of government or state, finance ministers, foreign ministers, and other high-ranking officials from each member country. The European Union is represented by the European Commission and the European Central Bank. Additionally, various countries, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations are often invited to participate in these crucial summits, making it a diverse platform for addressing pressing global challenges. The G20 operates without a permanent secretariat or headquarters. Instead, the G20 president, chosen annually, plays a crucial role in shaping the agenda by consulting with other member countries and responding to global economic developments. To ensure fairness, the G20 presidency rotates yearly, following a system designed to maintain regional balance. The 19-member countries are divided into five groups, each containing no more than four countries. The presidency then moves between these groups, with a different country assuming the role each year.`,

    `The Earth, often referred to as the "Blue Planet," is a marvel of the cosmos. It is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system, distinguished by its unique ability to support a diverse range of life forms. Earth's breathtaking landscapes, intricate ecosystems, and dynamic climate make it a planet like no other. One of the most striking features of our planet is its diverse geography. From the highest peaks of the Himalayas to the deepest ocean trenches, Earth's landscapes are a testament to the forces of nature. Mountains, deserts, forests, grasslands, and oceans provide habitats for a rich tapestry of flora and fauna, each uniquely adapted to their environments. Earth's oceans, covering more than 70 percent of its surface, are teeming with life. Coral reefs, kelp forests, and the open ocean are home to a dazzling array of marine species, from the smallest plankton to the largest whales. The oceans play a crucial role in regulating the planet's climate and are a source of sustenance for millions of people around the world. The Earth's atmosphere, a mixture of gases, is essential for life as we know it. Oxygen, nitrogen, and trace gases make up the air we breathe, while the ozone layer shields us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. The atmosphere also influences the planet's climate, with weather patterns and climatic zones varying across the globe. However, the Earth is facing a host of environmental challenges. Human activities, such as deforestation, industrial emissions, pollution, and the burning of fossil fuels, have contributed to climate change and the loss of biodiversity. The consequences of these actions are becoming increasingly evident, with rising global temperatures, more frequent extreme weather events, and the decline of numerous species. Addressing these challenges requires a collective effort from the global community. As inhabitants of Earth, we have a shared responsibility to protect and preserve our planet for current and future generations. This includes adopting sustainable practices, conserving natural resources, and reducing our ecological footprint. Efforts to combat climate change, transition to renewable energy sources, and protect vulnerable ecosystems are critical steps in safeguarding the Earth's future. Environmental conservation, wildlife protection, and the promotion of sustainable agriculture are essential components of responsible stewardship of our planet. In conclusion, the Earth is a remarkable and fragile planet, home to an incredible diversity of life and natural wonders. It is our duty to act as caretakers of this planet, ensuring that it remains a habitable and vibrant world for generations to come.`,

    `What true success actually is? How to have a successful life? Why only a handful of people achieve success while others fail? What is the key to success? These are some of the questions that always hover in the minds of millions of people. There is no denying that everyone wishes to become successful and earn name and fame. Some people have this thinking that if they gather a lot of bank balance and have a big car outside their house, they will be successful. I have personally observed in people who have a huge bank balance they do not have substantial relationships. Would you really call it success? What I call success in true sense of the term is when one achieves success in terms of health, prosperity, relation and spirituality. These, I believe, are the four pillars of leading a happy, healthy and successful life. In case we have a lot of dreams, but also have a sense of fear towards accomplishing those dreams, then we will not be able to achieve anything. Fear is that phenomenon which makes our brain inactive and leaves it incapable of doing anything. Fear of failure prevents us from embarking on our dreams. It leaves us in a depressed state and makes us question ourselves "What if I fail in my endeavors, what will happen then?" If you really want to transform your dream into reality, then you will have to learn the art of overcoming your fear and fighting back. Fear has a tendency of frustrating you even before you take a step ahead. It can leave you shattered. So, keep your fear at bay and cultivate courage within yourself. If you are courageous and have a firm faith in yourself, you can even destroy a mountain. Impossible becomes possible! Opportunities do not strike again and again. We tend to lose many opportunities in life simply because we lack enough courage to do things. Every time we leave things on 'tomorrow' and say from tomorrow I will make a fresh start. Tomorrow never comes. If you cannot begin now; then perhaps tomorrow also will never come! You can at least start taking small steps because beginning is very important. The people in Japan know this secret because they start their regular job and achieve their goal at any cost. If harmonium, guitar or dance is what you want to learn, then start learning it without any delay, i.e. without waiting for tomorrow.`,

    `Swami Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta, on 12 January 1863 at his ancestral home in Calcutta. He was one of the nine siblings and his father Vishwanath Datta was working as an attorney in the Calcutta High Court. Swami Vivekananda's mother Bhubaneswari Devi was a devout housewife. As a child he was quite naughty and always restless as described by his mother. She is also known to have once said that "I prayed to Shiva for a son and he has sent me one of his demons"; probably a reference to Vivekananda's naughtiness. Swami Vivekananda first came to know about Ramkrishna Paramhans during a literature lecture at General Assembly's Institution in Calcutta in 1881. Professor of English Literature, William Hastie was lecturing on a poem titled "The Excursion", written by William Word's worth. It so happened that during the lecture, the word "trance" had appeared in the poem. It was then that the professor told his students that they should meet Ramkrishna of Dakshineswar, if they ever want to understand the true meaning of trance. First meeting of Swami Vivekananda with Ramkrishna, occurred in November 1881 at a common friend's house where Ramkrishna was delivering a lecture. The second meeting which took place in early 1882 when Vivekananda went to Dakshineswar to meet Ramkrishna, proved to be a turning point in his life. Though, Vivekananda initially rejected the ideas and philosophy of Ramkrishna as impractical and a kind of hallucination; he was impressed by the personality of Ramkrishna and started routinely visiting Dakshineswar. After the death of his father in 1884, his family was literally forced into penury, and it was the time when Vivekananda came closer to Ramkrishna Paramhans as he found solace in latter's company. In 1885, Ramkrishna Paramhans developed throat cancer and before leaving for heavenly abode, he gave his disciples ochre robes, forming his first ever monastic order. During this time Swami Vivekananda was taught that "service to men was the most effective worship of God". Ramkrishna also asked his other disciples to consider Vivekananda as their leader, asking Vivekananda in turn to take care of others. There had never been as great a spiritual leader in the world history as Swami Vivekananda. He introduced the Hindu religion and philosophy to the world, giving it a global recognition. His words have inspired millions across faiths, religion and culture. He toured throughout the length and breadth of India extensively, like a monk.`,

    `In India, there are several temples of 'Bal Ganesh', 'Bal Gopal', 'Bal Krishna', 'Bal Hanuman' i.e. Childhood of God. According to Hindu philosophy, a child is considered to be form of God. India is better known to be the country of Dhruv, Prahalad, Lav-Kush and Abhimanyu, the children having talents wisdom, intelligence and carrierships. Apart from this, present day picture of poor Indian child is very dark. The poor child is the most neglected, most exploited and the most abused. Female child is the most deprived and under privileged of the whole class of such children. The girls are not only withdrawn from schools and forced to indulge in child labor but they are even dragged in the prostitution. Child labor is violation of human rights and is considered to be a 'necessary evil' in any country in the whole world. It hampers their normal and natural physical, mental, spiritual, intellectual, emotional, moral and social development. Children are doing work as domestic servants. They are employed in hotels, workshops, service stations, shops, construction sites and pulling rickshaws etc. They are even working in hazardous and unhygienic forms of labor in manufacturing factories. Article 24 of the Constitution of India, 1950 says, "No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or employed in any hazardous employment". Indian legislature has also enacted the Factories Act, 1948, The Children Act, 1960, The Child Labor Prohibition and Regulation Act, 1986 etc. for the protection of rights of children. Article 45 of the Constitution of India, 1950 casts duty on the State to endeavor to provide free and compulsory education to the children. Article 25, 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights also states about the special care and assistance for the motherhood and children. For the past few years, work done by the Government of India and the States Government in this issue is praiseworthy. Many new schemes and policies are introduced for the education and betterment of the children. But, this problem is still in existence in India even though all these policies are available in India. There may no other opinion that child labor should be restricted and if possible completely vanished. It is a socio-economic national problem, which requires close analysis and practical solutions to meet with this burning question.`,

    "A difference in opinions, values, attitudes and lifestyle among people of different ages is called 'generation gap'. Due to these differences, people belonging to different generations find themselves unable to relate to each other. This communication gap between successive generations is not a new phenomenon. The fight between the old and the young is not new and has been bound in the culture of every nation of the world. Parents and children across the world have been facing this problem. Due to fast-paced modern lifestyles, parents and children hardly find time together. The children, thus unable to express their thoughts and ideas to their parents, turn to friends for advice who are as inexperienced as they are. In the era of globalization and liberalization, the gap between the young the old reached its zenith. Today's children are born into a competitive world and have a struggle to get everything. Many a time their true potential gets overshadowed in the rat race. Parents- burdened by the expectations of the society- end up forcing certain subjects and careers and lives that their parents have chosen for them, children are left lost and confused. Parents, on the other hand, feel that in this rapidly changing society where everyone is so self-centered, it is their duty to protect their children. Parents tend to feel that their children require guidance. This cannot be denied. But their constant monitoring makes children feel oppressed and they tend to turn rebellious. Thus, generation gap is destroying the basic human relationship and is obviously a threat to the social stability of family relations. It is essential for parents to talk to their children and treat them as individuals. To be forever treated as child can be irritating and sometimes even humiliating. Children, in turn, must reciprocate with due respect and attention. Matters such as career, lifestyle and sensitive issues like freedom of choice of friends must be dealt with carefully and with maturity. Love and understanding are the best antidotes to this ever-widening generation gap. Only then will children look up to their parents and parents will not be burdened with their guilt of not being there for their children in their hour of need. In this way generation gap can at least be narrowed, if not completely filled.",
